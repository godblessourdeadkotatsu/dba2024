	\section{Conclusions}
	This brief discussion tackled the theme of pitch-shifting by a frequency-domain approach. By doing so, we examined in depth the FFT algorithm, which is at the heart of most common frequency-domain audio manipulations. We started by stating the need for an efficient algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform
